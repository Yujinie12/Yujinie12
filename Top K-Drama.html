    <h2>Business Proposal</h2>
    <p>Shin Ha-ri (Kim Se-jeong) goes on a blind date in place of her friend, Jin Young-seo (Seol In-ah), whose father had arranged it. Young-seo had not wanted to attend and asks Ha-ri to go instead with the goal of having Ha-ri 'getting rejected' by her friend's prospective partner. However, the plans go awry when the prospective partner turns out to be Kang Tae-mu (Ahn Hyo-seop), the CEO of the company where Ha-ri works. Tae-mu decides to marry his blind date partner without knowing she is fake Jin Young-seo or that she is his employee, which she tries assiduously to hide. The fake identity (but not her employment status) however is soon exposed after the real Jin Young-seo gets into a parking incident with Cha Sung-hoon (Kim Min-kyu), Tae-mu's executive assistant, who at that moment was acting as Tae-mu's driver.</p>

    <h2>Our Beloved Summer</h2>
    <p>A coming-of-age romantic comedy that revolves around Choi Ung (Choi Woo-shik) and Kook Yeon-soo (Kim Da-mi), ex-lovers who broke up with a promise to never meet again. As luck would have it, the documentary they filmed ten years ago in high school went viral and they are forced to face the cameras together again by their producer friend. The series depicts their complicated feelings and growth.
This drama shows what love feels like. Instead of discussing practical issues like family conflicts, it tells a story about throb, memory and dream. Romance is revealed in many small, unnoticed acts.</p>
