<h2> All of Us Are Dead</h2>
<p>If you haven't tuned into All Of Us Are Dead , what are you waiting for? Seriously. In only two weeks, the K-drama series has become the next big thing on social media. With tons of drama, an apocalyptic plague, and even a little love story hidden throughout the 12-episodes, All Of Us Are Dead has all the makings of a perfectly binge-able, must-watch series.</p>
<br>
<p>Don't believe me? If high school isn't hard enough, a group of students are forced to go into Hyosan High School after a virus outbreak emerges in Hyosan City, turning most infected people into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Others, who retain their normal human looks and mobility, never fully transform into zombies. Nicknamed Halfbies, these human and zombie hybrids function normally, but they gain enhanced abilities like super-strength and hearing.

With tons of twists and turns, the show kept viewers on its toes, sharing their thoughts on social media. If you're wondering how season one of All Of Us Are Dead ends, read ahead for everything we know so far.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>All Of Us Are Dead is based on the popular Naver webtoon of the same name by webtoon creator Joo Dong-geun. Webtoons are vertical, continuous strips of mobile-friendly illustrated stories that can span genres from romance to horror.</p>
